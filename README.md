Submerged History: Remembering the Old Cheyenne Agency

## Project description: 
The Old Cheyenne Agency was a significant cultural and administrative center for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, 
but it was flooded and its precise location under the Missouri River is now uncertain. Its loss reflects a broader 
erasure of Indigenous heritage due to large-scale infrastructure projects. There is currently limited public knowledge 
or access to its physical history. Understanding and acknowledging submerged Indigenous sites is crucial for historical accuracy, 
cultural preservation, and reconciliation.
